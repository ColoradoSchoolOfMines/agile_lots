Description:
The SmartLots project aims to create a real-time web interface to show just how many cars are in a given lot on campus. Using magnetometer sensors and the power of physics, we can figure out when a car enters and leaves a lot. This information is uploaded to a website for easy viewing and made available to anyone. Now you can tell when the CTLM lot is full, rather than waste 5 minutes of gas and time driving around to find that there are no spots.



Steps:
	1) Sense a car passing through a parking lot entrance/exit [magnetrometer]
	2) Determine the direction [arduino]
	3) send info to web server [pi]
	4) Update lot displays accordingly [webserver]

Hardware Inventory:
	9 Waterproof Cases
	2 Magnetrometers [Sparkfun Part No. HMC5883L]
	2 Fio Arduino
	3 Uno Arduino
	2 Arduino Batteries
	3 Rasperry Pi(one with case)
		4GB MicroSD Card with SD Adapter
	2 Xbee (one broken)
