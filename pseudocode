int x, y, z; // Stuff from first magnetrometer
int x1, y1, z1; // Stuff from second magnetrometer

SETUP:
	Setup Magnetrometers

LOOP:
	Keep a running average of the magnetic field sensed by the magnetrometer
		Decide If Car Passes
		BIG SPIKE in magnetrometer data means a car passed
		N units of time pass, and then other magnetrometer sees BIG SPIKE
		Determine Direction of Passing
	Report Car Passing and Direction
